  * Ad performance Merics
     * **CTR** is the number of clicks that your ad receives divided by the number of times your ad is shown: clicks ÷ impressions = CTR. For example, if you had 5 clicks and 100 impressions, then your CTR would be 5%.
     * **CVR** is calculated by dividing the number of users who converted by the number of users who clicked on the ad, and then multiplying by 100. For example, if 1,000 users saw an ad and 15 users installed the advertised app, the CVR would be 1.5%.

## System Design Interview: Design an Ad Click Aggregator 
https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/answer-keys/ad-click-aggregator

**Ad Click Aggregator** is a system that collects and aggregates data on ad clicks. It is used by advertisers to track the performance of their ads and optimize their campaigns. 

<img width="939" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-18 at 4 41 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05aab247-9be3-4963-868f-ca76c24bf95a">



#### Functional Requirements 
1. Users can click on an ad and be redirected to the advertiser's website
2. Advertisers can query ad click metrics over time with a minimum granularity of 1 minute
3. Ad targeting
4. Ad serving
5. Cross device tracking
6. Integration with offline marketing channels

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Scalable to support a peak of 10k clicks per second
2. Low latency analytics queries for advertisers (sub-second response time)
3. Fault tolerant and accurate data collection. We should not lose any click data.
4. As realtime as possible. Advertisers should be able to query data as soon as possible after the click.
5. Idempotent click tracking. We should not count the same click multiple times.
(Optional)
6. Fraud or spam detection
7. Demographic and geo profiling of users
8. Conversion tracking

#### API / System Interface
* Input: 
  1. Click Data
  2. Advertiser Query
   
* Output:    
  1. Redirect 
  2. Aggregrated Click Metrcis

### Data Flow 
1. User clicks on an ad on a website.
2. The click is tracked and stored in the system.
3. The user is redirected to the advertiser's website.
4. Advertisers query the system for aggregated click metrics.


### High-Level Design
#### 1) Users can click on ads and be redirected to the target
When a user clicks on an ad which was placed by the **Ad Placement Service**, we will send a request to our `/click` endpoint, which will track the click and then redirect the user to the advertiser's website.

 * Two ways we can handle this redirect
 1) **Client side redirect:** When a user clicks on the ad, the browser will automatically redirect them to the target URL. The downside with this approach is that users could go to an advertiser's website without us knowing about it.
 2) **Server side redirect:** A more robust solution is to have the user click on the ad, which will then send a request to our server. Our server can then track the click and respond with a redirect to the advertiser's website via a 302 (redirect) status code. This way, we can ensure that we track every click and provide a consistent experience for users and advertisers. This approach also allows us to append additional tracking parameters to the URL

#### 2) Advertisers can query ad click metrics over time at 1 minute intervals
A simple design will be have a Click DB send data to the query service; there are lots of DB can be choosed, one way is to use Cassandra/(Amazon Keyspaces), where it was `write` optimazied in which it can support fast insertion & table updates.

To **reduce contention** (aka. resource competiton) for separating heavy database writes/reads, and to support **fault isolation** in which 1 database down will not affect the other database serving.
